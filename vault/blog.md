I've finally moved away from trying every blog hosting platform out there, and started self-hosting stuff I write.

Why?

* I don't use git in my current job, and after almost a year, it's beginning to feel like an itch that I need to scratch.
* I'd like to not pay for someone else to own my content (even if there isn't much, it's still _mine_).
* I need a reason to learn how to use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), and [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) seems like a good enough reason. I also like how easy and simple 11ty is to use.
* With practically every blog provider, I find that sooner or later I begin to frequently check visits and subscribers. Self-hosting means I have to put in some effort to do such stuff, so for this blog I'm just going to set up an RSS feed and leave it at that.

Will this make any difference to how much I write? That remains to seen...
