Stuff I did:

* added a [bookshelf](/bookshelf) and a [journal](/journal) to this blog.
* bought a Playstation VR kit (for S's birthday). It's super cool (Minecraft is amazing in VR)
* played [Sackboy](https://www.playstation.com/en-se/games/sackboy-a-big-adventure/) every evening with S. Lots of fun.
* played tons of Minecraft with R. We're still heavy into creative mode, but starting to explore survival mode.
* bought a fuse bead set (finally). R and I put together a Minecraft carrot.
* slowly making my way through [Plato's Republic](https://www.amazon.com/Republic-Oxford-Worlds-Classics-Plato/dp/0199535760/), and [Clear and simple as the truth](https://www.amazon.com/Clear-Simple-Truth-Writing-Classic/dp/0691147434/)
* made some progress with the [Statistical rethinking](https://github.com/ivaturi/statistical-rethinking-2022) course. This is going painfully slowly.
* went to see the [Natural History museum](https://www.gnm.se/)
