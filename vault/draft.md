How big a team do you really need, to build something? 

I've worked in places where someone comes up with an idea, then they ask for help. If they're lucky, they get some additional resources and eventually run into bottlenecks.  It could be anything - the scope of the idea grew, the expectations on what the team would deliver grew, the number of "this would be super helpful/cool" ideas grew. 

Almost always, one of the first solutions that most people align on is that they need more people, because _there's too much to do_. But what happens when you add new people? You get more opinions, sure, and you get the additional competence. And maybe, just maybe you are able to actually do more than you could before you got the additional person.
