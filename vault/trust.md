One thing that's really hard to do when working backwards from a deadline - specially if you are the person responsible for planning and delivering things - is to curb the instinct to make a list of things to do. Or worse, a list of things _that ought have been done_ by the date. 

This is how this goes, more often than not:

1. Someone makes a list of things that need to be done.
2. Someone calls for a meeting to make sure everyone is _aligned_ on what needs to be done. During the meeting, someone asks if all the stakeholders are aware of the list of things to be done, and if the list of things to be done is actually a list of _all_ the things to be done, because we don't want to add more things to the list of things being done. Everyone agrees to have a sync meeting once a week, until further notice.
3. Someone assigns tasks to people. All tasks aren't assigned, however, because people have other meetings to go to. Everyone agrees to take up the rest of the tasks in the upcoming sync meeting.
4. Sync meeting: Someone brings up that, uh, one of the stakeholders is quitting and there needs to be a decision on who will take up their work. It is agreed that this work will be deprioritized.
5. Sync meeting: someone complains that people have been talking outside of sync meetings and that this makes it hard for them to keep track of what's happening. Everyone agrees to split up the tasks into responsibility areas, and each area will organize a sync meeting with its stakeholders. And the _main_ sync meeting will keep happening, so _everyone_ can keep up with what's happening.
6. Sub-sync meeting: Someone brings up that their tasks are always delayed because the other stakeholders don't keep delivering what they promised they would. A lot of emails go around, with powerpoints about what was and wasn't agreed upon.
7. Sync meeting: the person who made the list of things to be done things this project is falling apart. Maybe we should start working agile, in sprints? Nobody disagrees with the proposal (some people think we're already working agile...aren't we?).
8. Sync meeting: the list of things do be done is now in buckets. Each bucket has a first name ("Sprint") and a last name (a number). Everyone agrees that the next sprint should probably be 4 weeks long, and that we should try to finish the list of things in the next bucket by the end of the month. Excel sheets go around with time schedules (replace excel with jira if you're feeling lucky)
9. Sync meeting, 4 weeks later: a bunch of stuff has been done, a bunch hasn't. Everyone thinks agile is a good way forward. Someone suggest having a sprint planning meeting for the next round, so we go back to step 1. 


(If you're lucky, someone has documented the outcome of each of these steps. If you're doubly lucky, the documentation is not in a repository that you have to VPN into. If you're triply lucky, the documentation is not in a bunch of word, excel, and powerpoint files)

Inevitably, at some point during this process, someone complains about there being too few people to do the things that need to get done. Obviously, the answer is to hire more people (let's grow the company!). 

What's less obvious is that the list of things to be done is the culprit. When you work backwards from a deadline, it is very easy to make a case for a things-to-de-done approach, but unless you know practically everything there is to know about the problem you're solving, you're never going to have a complete list of things that need to be done. If you do know practically everything there is know about how to solve a problem, you won't have a problem prioritizing what needs to be done, and knowing when and how you expect to be done with the list of things to be done. 

This means you start off not knowing the full extent of the problem, and making an initial attempt at making a list of things to do. However, you still believe in _the list_, so if you're not able to get everything done, you believe that the problem isn't the list but the people - you need more people so you can deliver more things on time. 

What if you don't believe in _the list_? What if you focused not on a list of things that need to be done, but a list of problems that need to be solved? What if you were able to take a problem, and break it down into a smaller set of problems, and scope the smaller problems into things your existing team can solve, with the expertise they already have?

This is hard to do, because this requires you to divorce your deadlines. This requires you to be able to trust someone enough that you give them a problem and ask them if they feel comfortable solving it - their own way - within a given time frame. And staying away from it unless you're asked to intervene or interfere. This requires you to have fewer _sync_ meetings and more conversations about how you can facilitate the problem of people applying their skills productively. This is scary territory. Yet, if you don't do it, who will?
