There are people who are uncomfortable with uncertainty. They prefer to gather *all* information about something before they decide to act. They are the people who are always talking about _eliminating_ risk, constantly making sure _everyone_ is aligned, making detailed plans before acting - plans that are driven by deadlines and _things to do_. They _require_ the future to be predictable.

People uncomfortable with uncertainty aren't too keen on failing, because when they fail, they fail big. They fail downwards, with a high likelihood of not having learnt much from the failure. 

There are people who are comfortable with uncertainty. They prefer to act on _some_ information, rather than wait until they have everything. These are people who are more willing to risk taking on something that they don't fully understand. They prefer to _manage_ risk rather than fight to eliminate it. People comfortable with uncertainty don't mind failure - they expect it, and expect to learn from it. They make plans that work backwards from _problems to solve_, rather than _dates to finish things by_. 

They accept uncertain futures. They are willing to take risks to push the now towards the future they imagine - a future that has one less problem; the one they are working to solve right now.
