**Highlights**

* Content wants to be used. It's there to meet the needs of its audience. You spend all that time and money creating it because you think it will meet a predefined objective. But first, people have to find it. And when they do, they have to make sense of it. When people arrive straight into the middle of your structure (and they do), they have limited patience to make sense of what they find.
