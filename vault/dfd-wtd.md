### Prompt

The section **Outline your users' needs** covers basic questions that all users have.  
Some are general: What is this product? Will it solve my problem?   Others are specific: How do I use your API/other feature? The authors assert that we should be identifying the answers to these questions through channels other than our own experience with the product. And that we generally know more about our product than our users, which means we're likely forgetting to document some very valuable info.

In the section **Validate your user understanding**, the authors look at methods useful for answering these questions:  

-   Use existing data sources, like support and marketing.
-   Gather new data by directly interacting with the users.

> _How do you get access to/share existing data (on your own, as a team, or as an entire organization)?_
> 
> _How do you get buy-in/make time for/actually plan and execute direct interviews, surveys, or other methods not covered in this section?_

### Answers

* Oof. I get access to and share information by lurking in all the slack channels I can find, poking around in JIRA when I have the time, and watching confluence pages. But making time for the rest… in my current role that falls apart quite often due to time zones and the fact that I’m sprinting somewhat far behind the developers… so I’m conscious of the fact that any questions I have for them is going to draw them out of their current work, slow them down, and I might require a good amount of back and forth that doesn’t go very quickly asynchronously.(Also, thanks for this great prompt, Amoreen! I’d love to see separate posts for each question so that we can thread separately if it makes sense, but I’m not sure that it will for every prompt you have in mind)

### Prompt

The section **Condensing user research findings** covers how to make sure that info obtained from research isn't lost. The authors suggest user personas, user stories, and user journey maps

> _How to implement these tools into the development–documentation loop? 
> 
> At what point(s) are personas, stories, and/or maps used? Who are they available for? And who creates them?_
