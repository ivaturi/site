- We don't have to know everything about something in order to understand it. Knowing too much can get in the way of understanding, just as much as knowing too little. 
- A good reader is able to demand more of himself *and* of the text before him, by reading actively instead of treating it as a passive effort.
- Active reading is similar to catching pitches: the pitcher (writer) and the catcher (reader) share an active relationship through the passive medium of the ball (book).
- If you understand perfectly everything the author has to say, you gain information but don't increase your understanding.
- The best way to increase understanding is to go to work on the book without any external help. You operate on the symbols before you in a way that you gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of understanding more (_skilled reading_).
- Communication between unequals must be possible, or else one person could never learn from another.
- Sometimes, merely reciting received facts can improve understanding.
- Being informed is a necessary pre-requisite for being enlightened.
- To be informed is to know that something is the case. To be enlightened is to know, in addition, what it is all about. You only achieve enlightenment when you can understand what an author means and why they say it.
- The difference between instruction and learning is the difference between aided and unaided discovery. 
- The art of reading includes the same skills involved in the art of unaided discovery: keen observation, readily available memory, range of imagination, and an intellect trained in analysis and reflection.
- If you ask a book a question you must answer it *yourself*. A book answers you only to the extent that you do the work of thinking and analysis yourself.
- Different levels of reading: elementary reading (*what does the sentence say?*), inspectional reading (systematic skimming - *what is the sentence about?*), analytical reading, syntopical (comparative) reading. 
- Analytical reading is reading with an explicit goal of understanding; at this level, the reader works at a book until it becomes their own ("chewing and digesting").
- A syntopical reader can, with the help of books read, analyze the subject in a way that is not in any of the books. This is the most active and effortful kind of reading.

- **Inspectional reading/systematic skimming**: the main aim is to discover whether the book requires a more careful reading.
    1. Read the title page
    2. Read the preface (quickly)
    3. Study the table of contents
    4. Check the index
    5. Read the publisher's blurb (usually on the dust jacket)
    6. Look at chapters that seem pivotal to the book's argument (review the summary statements carefully)
    7. Turn the pages, dipping in here and there, reading a paragraph or two, sometimes several pages in sequence (never more)
- When systematically skimming a book, read through the end, even if you don't understand parts here and there. Come back to the difficult parts on the second or third read - they will make more sense given the larger context.
- _Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension._
