### The challenge of the future

- _What important truth do very few people agree with you on?_ Most answers to this question are different ways of seeing the present; good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future.
- Courage is in shorter supply than brilliance.
- What makes the future distinctive and important isn't that it hasn't happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today.
- If you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made *horizontal progress*. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you have made *vertical progress*.
- At the macro level, horizontal progression corresponds to globalization: taking things that work somewhere, and making them work everywhere. The single word for vertical (zero to one) progress is technology. Technology is any new and better way of doing things.
- The smartphones that distract us from our surroundings also distract us from the fact that our surroundings haven't improved dramatically since the mid-90s.
- Positively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future. A new company's most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.


### Party like it's 1999

- To be able to answer the contrarian question, it is easier to start with identifying what everybody agrees on. If you can identify a delusiional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.
- It is better to risk boldness than triviality
- A bad plan is better than no plan
- Competitive markets destroy profits
- Sales mattesr just as much as product
- TO build the next generation of companies we must abandon existing dogmas. THat doesn't mean the opposite ideas are automatically true: you can't escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting them. Instead ask yourself how much of what you know [about business] is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes.
- The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.


### All happy companies are different

- The business version of the contrarian question is *what valuable company is nobody building?*
- Creating value is not enough - you also need to capture some of the value you create.
- Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away.
- If you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business.
- Monopolists lie to protect themselves. They know that bragging about their great monopoly invites being audited, scrutinized, and attacked. Since they very much want their monopoly profits to continue unmolested, they tend to do whatever they can to conceal their monopoly - usually by exaggerating the power of their (nonexistent) competition. They disguise their monopoly by framing their market as a union of several large markets.
- Non-monopolists tell the opposite lie: *we're in a league of our own*. The fatal temptation is to describe the market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition. The instinct is to come up with a story about how your [work/mission/company] is different. You spend time trying to convince people that you are exceptional instead of seriously considering whether that is true. Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining theor market as the intersection of various smaller markets.
- If you focus on trivial differentiating factors and lose sight of competitive reality, your business is unlikely to survive.
- The problem with a competetive business goes beyond lackof profits - you're not that different from dozens of your competitors, so you've got to fight hard to survive.
- In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today's margins that it can't possibly plan for a long-term future. Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.
- In a static world, a monopolist is just a rent collector. If you corener the market for soething, you can jack up the price; others will have no choice but to buy from you.
- Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world. They are powerful engines for making the society better.
- The history of progress is a history of better monopoly businesses replacing incumbents.
- In business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death. If your industry is in a competitive equilibrium, the death of your business won't matter - some other undifferentiated competitor will always be ready to take your place.
- Every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.


### The ideology of competition

- Inside a firm, people become obsessed with their competitors for career advancement. Then the firms themselves become obsessed with their competitors in the marketplace. People lost sight of what matters and focus on their rivals instead.
- Rivalry causes us to hallucinate opportunites where none exist, and to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what was worked in the past, [or elsewhere].
- Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn't the one worth fighting.
- Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that's true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don't throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly.


### Last mover advantage

- A great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future. The value of a business is the sum of all the money it will make in the future.
- Most of the value of low-growth businesses is in the near term.
- Growth is ieasy to measure, but durability isn't. Those who succumb to measurement mania obsess over weekly active user statistics, monthly revenue targets, and quarterly earnings reports.
- If you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: *will this business still be around a decade from now?* Numbers alone won't tell you the answer; instead you must think critically about the qualitative characteristics of your business.
- Monopolies share some combination of proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
  - Proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension (to lead to a real monopolistic advantage). Anything else will be perceived as a marginal imporvement and will be hard to sell in a competitive market.
  - Network effects can be powerful, but you'll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small.
  - Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous.
- To effectively leverage brand, scale, network effects, and technology, you need to choose your market carefully and expand deliberately.
- Every startup is small at the start, and every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. 
- It is easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial market is too big, it most certainly is.


### You are not a lottery ticket

- When people lack concrete plans to carry out, they use formal rules to assemble a portfolio of various options (by the time a student gets to college, he has spent a decade curating a diverse resume to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he is ready - for nothing in particular)
- Different view of the future:
  - Indefinite pessimism: looking out onto a bleak future, having no idea what to do about it.
  - Definite pessimism: believing the future can be known (but bleak) and being prepared for it.
  - Definite optimism: belief that the future will be better than now if there is a plan and effort to make it better.
  - Indefinite optimism: belief that the future will be better, but that it can't be known how exactly; there are no specific plans.
- Definite optimism works when you build the future you envision. Definite pessimism works by building what can be copied without expecting anything new. 
- Leanness is a methodology, not a goal. Making small changes to things that already exist might lead you to a local maximum, but it won't help you find the global maximum.
