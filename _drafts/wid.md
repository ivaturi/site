### How words shape experiences

A writing mindset asks: How many words will fit here? How should I describe this action? What terms are we using elsewhere? A design mindset asks: What terms are our users familiar with? What happens next? What problem are we really trying to solve? You can’t have one without the other—and you need them both. 

When a product is usable, it means that people can use it without coaching or help.

Design experiences that are accessible to everyone include different literacy levels, cultural backgrounds, and disabilities. Usable writing works for all your users, no matter who they are. 

For your words to be useful, you need to understand and honor the intent of your users. 

Useful writing focuses on what people want from your product or service and asks how you can balance that with business goals, rather than focusing purely on what the business can get out of it. 

As a writer, it’s your responsibility to consider not just how your writing will be used, but also how it could be misused, whether it’s by an algorithm, others in your company, or malicious people outside it. 

What does it mean to design something by writing? It means that your words are building someone’s experience. 

When you make decisions that affect the experience someone else has, you’re designing. 

On teams where the writer and designer are two different roles, both should be aware that they’re serving the same users and working toward the same goals. It’s not a question of one or the other. One doesn’t come earlier or later. It’s a collaboration that creates the user experience. 

“If you’re joining a project at the very end and there’s low tolerance for questions, it’s a sign your role as writer hasn’t been well positioned or isn’t well understood.”

Titles don’t matter when you’re trying to do the writing. What matters is that your team delivers words that meet the needs of your users throughout their experience. Writing is part of delivery. To create good software, you need words in it.

Some of the work of a writer involves giving other people guidelines or coaching so they can do their own writing. That’s important work, but it still requires that you think through the problem from the perspective of a writer who is designing the experience—someone who is using words to give meaning to each user’s experience.

The best way to spend your time may be by researching user needs, prototyping solutions, testing your ideas, creating a strategy, or building rationale for your decisions. You might even be leading the product team and driving alignment around the direction of the product development.

This is the greatest responsibility you have when you use writing to design experiences. You’re not simply coming up with labels for buttons and navigation—you’re changing how your users think. 

### Strategy and research

Content strategy is about more than cutting out the unnecessary or ineffective bits from your website. It’s about giving a large group of people a common framework for their decisions.

What does a good strategy look like? Here are some questions to ask yourself: 
- Is it actionable? Does the team know what to do? Do they know how it applies to them? 
- Is it relevant? Does it fit into the larger goals of your product or organization? Does it make sense in light of what other teams are doing? 
- Is it user-focused? Will your users benefit? Is it based on research? 
- Is it verifiable? Will reasonable people agree when it’s done? If you answer no or even maybe to any of these questions, it’s worth taking a second look at your strategy.

Research is never perfect, but it should also never be optional. It’s the best way to understand your users and their needs.

Don’t let opinion dictate the words you’re writing. Instead, move past the biases you and your team have and rely on insights and data about your users to make decisions.

You can’t create a good experience for your users if you don’t know much about them. You need to do your research. Whether you work with a research team or educate yourself, research is too important to skip.

Keeping your internal language out of interview questions will gives users the freedom to describe things in their own words. What you think of as a diagram, they may think of as a chart.

Another technique to learn about your users is contextual inquiry. It involves going to where your users are and observing their behavior in their own environment. You may ask questions, but the focus is on learning and observing what happens in your users’ world. By focusing on behavior and understanding the environment, you’ll be able to more clearly see the problems that your product can solve and how it could be used.

Usability tests consist of listing key tasks for the user to complete, observing them as they use the software to do those things, and describing their experience along the way. In these cases, you’re testing every aspect of the experience at once—the visuals, interactions, words, and, in some cases, even the performance of the code. As a writer, be sure that the tasks you’re testing include scenarios that rely on the language you’ve written. Include confirmation screens, error messages, and any situations where users need to understand the words.

Building a user-centered experience doesn’t happen through intuition. Knowing about your users and their behavior will help you find what’s appropriate for them more quickly, making your writing process more efficient and effective. Beyond that, research will begin to establish your user as the primary stakeholder. This is an important transformation for any team. At the end of the day, insight from users should be prioritized over anyone’s opinion—including your own. 

### Creating clarity

Whether or not you’re using the serial comma doesn’t matter so much as how much clarity it adds to your message. And to understand that, you need to understand the context of your message.

A lack of clarity isn’t just frustrating for members of the team, it’s also expensive. When everyone has a different understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve, they may ship a feature that isn’t needed or put up a web page that has to be revised a few days later.

Start by writing. Write without constraints or voice or tone.

If you design a digital product without focusing on the words, it’s easy to avoid thinking about the message that it sends to its users. When you take responsibility for the words in an interface, you are the last line of defense against manipulative practices, misinformation, and jargon. Thinking about the language intentionally means that you’re also thinking about its ethical implications—from how it could exclude people to the way it’s used to shape and influence behavior.

it’s important to collaborate with your team on the words as soon as possible, while a project’s scope is still new and malleable. It’s much easier to change wording—or even the product’s message—when it’s written on a white board or a Word doc than when it’s coded into an interface.

The Nielsen Norman Group, an organization that conducts user experience research, has a list of ten important usability heuristics for user interface design. (A heuristic is, broadly, a technique that allows someone to teach themselves something.) One heuristic that’s key for writers to understand is “recognition over recall”—in other words, make plain the object, action, and options a user has, so they don’t have to remember it.

Recall, a process your brain uses to retrieve information from your memory, is how you remember things like usernames, passwords, web addresses, and other open-ended prompts. Recognition, on the other hand, draws from many more overt clues to allow you to make a decision. An example might be a button with a clear call-to-action, for example, or a list of menu items. Each of these elements gives you the cues you need to recognize an option, make a decision, and ultimately accomplish your goal in an interface.

When it comes to design, Saito says, everything is a metaphor. “The gestures we use—clicking, tapping, or swiping, they’re all metaphors of something we’d do in the real world. And the icons we use—floppy disks for saving, and the cutting and the pasting. All metaphors.”

Metaphors help people make sense of your product. Saito says there are a couple things to keep in mind if you’re developing a metaphor: 

- Does this metaphor actually describe what the user is trying to do? 
- Don’t make me think: Is it common enough for a broad understanding, or is it too localized for my user base to under-stand it? 
- Is it internally consistent, or does it conflict with other terms and actions in my product?

If you work for a large company, you’ll often find information about your users’ language in places like call-center logs or support tickets. Build relationships with those teams and see if they can share their data. By breaking that data down, you’ll begin to see the most common patterns emerge, and you’ll be able to incorporate what you found into your writing.

That’s harder than it looks: Unless your company has a profoundly user-focused culture (and let’s face it, almost every company could be a bit more user-focused), it’s easy to get caught in a bubble of business and software development jargon. From customer service systems that ask if your issue has been resolved (do real people ever ask each other to “resolve issues”?) to technical errors that are only meaningful to the people that wrote them, there is plenty of opportunity to make language more understandable and simple. 

### When things go wrong

Error messages are one of the most highly visible and top-of-mind examples of UI writing out there. They come when users are expecting something else to happen, and often cause frustration and confusion. They’re usually the bearer of bad news—Oops, we can’t do that, or Sorry, something went wrong, so by their very nature, there’s no “good” error message. The best error message is no error message at all.

As people try to complete the task at hand, inevitably, they’ll run into negative moments, like error messages and warnings. These moments make it harder for them to get the thing done.

Start writing error messages, reframe error states as opportunities to help people get more done. 

“When you go to a product owner and say ‘Actually, this is way more complicated than you’re making it out to be, and unless you think about all these things, you’re not going to get the outcome you want,’ that sometimes doesn’t go over well,” Lucchese said. “That’s where you start thinking about metrics and measurements. You have to monetize the risk of not considering these things.”

Here are three principles for using words to design error states—one of them doesn’t even involve writing: • Avoid: Find ways to help your user without showing them an error. • Explain: Tell your users what’s going on and what went wrong. • Resolve: Provide a solution to the problem that the user is facing.

Resolution is about meeting users where they are and providing a path forward. It’s about helping users get things done.

Sometimes, helping users resolve the problem they’re facing is a challenge, because it means rethinking how the system was designed and built.

“We know that words can really hurt people or help them in their personal lives,” she said. “We can say really reassuring words to people, and it has this huge impact, and we can say hurtful words, and it can have a years-long impact, but we don’t really treat the words we write in interfaces that way.”

“It’s important that the copy you write aligns with the rest of the app, but it’s more important that you think about the impact your words can have on people’s lives outside the app.”

Chances are, when most people think of “design,” they’re not thinking of writing an error message or figuring out what a product’s stress cases are. However, they’re more than messages. They’re critical moments that can make or break the user experience. Since writing is designing, each error is an opportunity to help your users get things done and deliver a product that works for everyone. 

### Writing that works for everyone (inclusive and accessible)

Inclusive language helps everyone feel like your product is made for them,

When you think about your user base’s gender and sexuality, there are so many people you often and easily exclude.

if the language you use tells a potential user that you didn’t think about their experience when building this thing, they’re not going to use it.

Designers and writers often design and write for themselves when creating products. And even when they keep accessibility in mind, there’s a spectrum of people using their product throughout who might not have a great experience.

“Ideally, accessibility and inclusive design work together to make experiences that are not only compliant with standards, but truly usable and open to all.”

All of us experience disabilities in one way or another over our lifetime. By focusing on the universal ways that humans experience the world, designers and writers can magnify their impact of inclusion exponentially.

Companies need to let their users know what they’re doing when they collect this kind of information. Is it just for demographic reporting purposes? Is it for deciding what ads to show people? Or is it integral to the core function of the product? It’s hard, but it’s important for a writer to question the collection of data in their products.

As that writer, here are a few things you can ask yourself and your product team: • What are we going to do with this information? What sort of assumptions might we make based on this information? • How might someone misuse the information we’re collecting? If we’re gathering demographic data that we’re selling or otherwise making available to other people in the organization, how could someone use this information in an unethical way, even if it was against the will of your company? • How might asking for this information make someone’s experience harder? Who might experience stress or relive trauma because the information we’re asking for excludes them from answering?

You may think to yourself, “Well, this isn’t such a big deal. It’s just a choice on a form.” And you’d be right. In isolation, it’s a relatively small decision. But marginalized people face this tiny exclusion many—sometimes dozens—of times a day.

When you’re hanging out with a group of friends, you know how to talk to them, and you know how to talk about them. But when you’re writing for users, you don’t know who, specifically, those users will be. You don’t know their lived experiences. You don’t know their identity.

It’s easy to make assumptions based on someone’s experience or career, especially when you’re making professional software. Your goal is to write words that are clear and relatable to all users, not just the ones who are paying or completely understand your product

Designing for ourselves, and those with similar traits, is easy. Finding the words that best connect with ourselves, given our lived experiences, likes, and dislikes, is second nature. But questioning your own assumptions and learning about the needs of others is critical as technology takes over so much of our lives. If writing and designing with an inclusive mindset is new to you, you’re going to make mistakes. The important thing is that you respond appropriately and learn from them.

It shouldn’t be completely up to the people in underrepresented groups to bring these things up with the teams they work with, and making these issues part of the conversation creates a more inclusive tech industry.

Most screen readers will parse information from left to write, from top to bottom.

Inclusive, accessible experiences make technology more humane and welcoming. It’s not an optional add-in—it should be embedded in the way you work. 

### Voice, tone

A brand voice is the consistent, goal-driven expression of a brand through words. It serves to engage an audience or to motivate them to become customers. It’s how a brand would speak and write if it were a person. In essence, it’s an expression of the brand’s personality, and should be expressed in everything that the company produces—brochures, customer service phone trees, business cards, websites, social media presences, apps—everything.

A product voice is a bit more tactical than that. It definitely needs to fit within and carry the brand voice, but it might have a narrower set of goals and face a stricter set of constraints. It’s there to define what an app, a website, or a digital product produced by this brand sounds like.

Before you can work your way to a set of rules guiding how you or a team of writers choose how to write, you have to figure out what you want that voice to sound like. Do you want to come across as simple and powerful, like Apple (see Figure 6.3)? Do you want to be refreshingly clear and compelling like Capital One? Do you want to show that you’re at the intersection of art and science, like Adobe? This is where branding exercises will help, if that work hasn’t been done already, but you can also just develop principles on your own that you can use to explain your work.

List some words that describe your brand, and then explain each one by what it doesn’t mean. That second word helps writers better understand each personality trait.

If you’re in charge of maintaining or contributing to a larger voice documentation, you’ll start to notice patterns among successful messages that you test (more on that in the next chapter about tone). Start to look at microcopy and messaging opportunities that seem off-brand, or in a voice that doesn’t seem to fit with the larger system.

Discuss among your team, or if it’s just you, loop in a few product owners and designers: What about it seems off-voice? How do you change it to fit in better? And, of course, document your discussion and add it to the rest of your voice documentation. A good voice system is always evolving.

Keep in mind that guidelines aren’t nearly as important as how the voice is used in whatever work you’re building.

What’s important is that you know what you’re trying to accomplish, not that you have great guidelines. Guidelines that don’t affect the end product aren’t worth much.

There’s a common thread that weaves throughout most of the voice principles for digital experiences. Capturing the essence of the brand is important, but it should all be in service of three key principles that underlie the importance of writing the user experience. Here are three principles we’ve observed in the industry and use in our own work, in order of importance: be clear, concise, and human. Consider how these attributes fit into the vision for your product when developing voice principles.

List out every “we do this, we don’t do that” rule. Like for our Twitter presence, we say: “We don’t use jargon, we don’t ‘lol,’ we don’t culturally appropriate, we are elegant with language, we’re well-read, not showoffs, and somewhat esoteric. And yet, every single one can be caveated with . . . unless it’s appropriate or funny.”

Too few rules leave the voice too abstract for writers to align on. Too many rules leave them paralyzed and unable to work out how they should sound.

If you have a community of writers or communicators from across a range of experiences and contexts, try to get them in a room and show them your work. We’d even recommend getting that feedback from people who are outside the product work, from different roles.

It sounds silly, but one of the best ways to get a sense of your writing is to hear it being read aloud, even if that reader is yourself.
voice is great for connecting a product, an experience, or an interface to a brand. It really sets expectations for a user as to what kind of a company is behind the thing they’re using.

But some interfaces shouldn’t put that kind of focus on the brand. Their goal is to get someone through an interaction. And with some apps, the people who use it are in a hurry, stressed out, or perhaps even impaired.

It’s important to make sure that your product’s voice isn’t getting in the way of your users’ goals. You’ll want to ask yourself and your team some questions to balance branding with ease of use: • Speed vs. Engagement: How important is it to get the user through an interaction? • State of Mind: What is your user likely to be thinking about and feeling as they use your interface? • Brand Moment vs. Utility: How important is it to build brand awareness at this point of the user’s journey with your product?

“voice” doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to pick a unique way to write with a strong personality. Sometimes, choosing a “voice” means that your product is speaking in the plainest, simplest way possible.

you need a strategy for switching tone when appropriate.

voice is the personality that your brand, or product, or digital interface manifests, which sets it apart from others. Tone is the way that voice is expressed in certain contexts, i.e., to respond to or guide a user through a particular workflow or interaction.

“Tone is so incredibly important because I think it’s the thing that kills most interfaces,” she said. “You know pretty immediately when you’re talking to someone if they’re a jerk, or if they think they’re better than you, or if they seem pretty friendly, or if they’re talking to you in a way that seems respectful. The same social skills govern our perception of technology, as well as humans, and determine whether we’re willing to engage in or persist with an interaction.”

Digital is different. You’re not always communicating in such a directional way. Writers don’t have the luxury of always setting the topic and crafting a message around it. Communication doesn’t flow so linearly; it’s contextual, and things change depending on the following information: • Where users are in the journey • How experienced they are in using the interface • What their intentions are • What their mood is: how receptive they are to what you are guiding them to do.

Writing for digital experiences is a conversation; however, it’s not necessarily a conversation in the traditional sense where two or more parties are verbally talking back and forth (although with the rise of chatbots and voice interfaces, that’s becoming more and more relevant). Rather, it’s conversational in the sense that it flows with a give-and-take of information, a rhythm, and a contextual understanding of the needs of the user. You can often look to real-life conversations as inspiration. There are two main factors to consider, which are the two parties in a conversation: you (the interface) and your users.

Tone is present in your writing whether or not you know it. When you write in a short, neutral, terse style, that’s a tone decision. Choosing not to emphasize the emotional aspects of an interface is also a tone choice.

Your goal is to get a user through an interaction or workflow to accomplish their goal. And because you don’t want well-meaning but uninformed stakeholders inserting their own tone, wouldn’t it be great to have a strategy? Even if your strategy is for the personality of the interface to be focused on helping users accomplish their tasks, make that clear to everyone involved.

Tone profiles give you and your team a framework that you can use to evaluate tone decisions.

It’s important to understand the full range of relationships a user of your product might have with you, so start with an audit of your company. Are you a large, multifaceted social network? Or are you a niche tool that does one thing, and one thing well?

As you audit, take inventory of what you have and capture examples. It can be hard to tell what needs to be inventoried. Is it every word in the interface, including every button, label, and piece of microcopy? Or is it just the more messaging-heavy text, like error messages, confirmation dialogs, and onboarding experiences? It’s all of the above, we’d argue. Sure, the more word-heavy messages have the room to be more explicit in their tone, but even one-or two-word labels are making tone choices.

Don’t rest on your laurels. You evolve as a writer. Your software evolves and changes. If you’re on a writing team, your dynamic evolves. It’s important that you revisit your tone framework regularly to see if it still makes sense.

The most important thing is that you’re being strategic in the way that you’re communicating with users, and thoughtfully considering their context as they interact with your interface.

### Collaboration and Consistency: Building Your Practice

Writing to design experiences isn’t about memorizing a list of the right and wrong ways to craft a sentence. Your users are unique, and your organization is unique. Your writing should embrace that.

Whenever you start working on a product, you may feel like everything is urgent—that you need to apply every lesson you’ve learned to what you’re working on. You don’t. It all comes down to meeting needs. Sometimes, people don’t need that cool UX deliverable you’ve been dreaming of creating. Don’t confuse making a deliverable with making a difference. Start by meeting the needs of your team (even if you have different priorities), and then you’ll have the support you need to meet the needs of your users. There’s so much that has to be written, and the pressure on product teams to deliver is constant, so you’ll find that they have all kinds of things for you to do, ranging from marketing messaging to interface copy to error strings.

If you care about words, you’ll likely find yourself asking a lot of questions about what you’re working on. This is because good writing makes things clear, and often, if no one has been focused on writing, things aren’t very clear.

We ask questions to understand the world around us. For many teams, no one has tried to understand the words that make up their product before. It’s threatening and unfamiliar to them.

Asking questions about the product and its purpose greatly increases your effectiveness. Go beyond asking about what happens in the interface and start asking about the problems the product is meant to solve. If you don’t understand what’s going on, how do you think your users will feel?

Since writing is designing, facilitation is a critical skill. You can help your team figure out what their intentions are. This is a critical part of what it means to design something. Facilitation is the act of bringing people along with you as you explore an idea, explain a concept, propose design changes, and more. Without facilitation, things just happen to you. With facilitation, you have the opportunity to apply design to every moment of every day. A lack of facilitation will leave you feeling ineffective, and it will leave your colleagues feeling like you’re out of touch. A good facilitator helps other people feel involved, excited, respected, and productive.

Tools are easy to learn. Clearly communicated ideas are much harder to come by.

critique is one of the most meaningful and productive ways you can use an hour with your coworkers. Critique should be energizing to you and your team. It should be an opportunity to hear a lot of different perspectives, and the work should be better afterward.

In the design world, maintaining consistency seems like a foregone conclusion. It’s given as a justification for almost any design decision, and leaders frequently push for it. However, consistency comes with a warning label: Without a strategy, any effort you make to be more efficient and consistent will just help you do the wrong things faster and more often.

Once your team agrees on style basics, is clear on strategy, and has identified some patterns that work for your users, you can focus on consistency and efficiency knowing it’s time well spent. A recent—and very positive—trend is to gather all the resources that a product team might need in a single place, usually called a design system. The best design systems are focused on meeting the needs of anyone who contributes to, or needs to access, design. They embody the vision your team has for the experience, and include resources that help people get their jobs done, whether they are designers, engineers, product managers, or executives.

Design systems work so well because modern interfaces are made up of lots of smaller components. Put them together and you get software interfaces. The people who create these systems tend to think of them as LEGO blocks. When you have enough of them, you can build anything you want.

Words give the elements of a design system meaning and utility. If your organization tries to establish reusable design patterns without considering them, you’ll sacrifice clarity and usability for the sake of efficiency.

The best design systems go beyond patterns and equip teams with the context they need to make consistent, strategic design decisions. This might include documentation (made up of words), explanations about context (also words), and version histories (which should also involve words).

“A design system is a product,” she says. “It’s a tool for a specific set of users under specific circumstances. Just like how documenting business processes does not create a product, documenting components does not create a design system. You need input from the people who will use it.”

Your skill as a writer isn’t defined by other people. There will always be people who don’t understand your work or have a negative opinion about it. But their opinion doesn’t change the truth that without words, there would be no experience for the user. Words are at the center of how an interface is understood by its users. Your work as a writer affects the usability and usefulness of the product.
