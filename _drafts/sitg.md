### Notes

**On having skin in the game**

Never engage in detailed overexplanations for *why* something important is important: endlessly justifying principles only serves to debases them.

Having skin in the game means being exposed to the real world, and paying a price for its consequences, good or bad.

Those who don't take risks must never be involved in making decisions.

Bureaucracy separates people from the consequences of their actions.

Individuals don't learn from their, or other people's, mistakes. Instead, the system learns by selecting those less prone to a certian class of mistakes and eliminating others. The experience of the system is grounded in filtering.

It is easier to know that something is wrong than to find the fix. We tend to know what is wrong with more clarity than what is right. 

Actions that remove are more robust than actions that add, because addition may have unseen, complicated feedback loops. 

Universal behavior is great on paper, and disastrous in practice. We are local and practical animals, sensitive to scale. The small is not the large, the tangible is not the abstract, the emotional is not the logical. We should focus on our immediate environment; we need simple practical rules. It is best to avoid going to the very general when saying hello to your garage attendant.

Avoid taking advice from people who provide advice for a living, unless there is a penalty for their advice.

The doer wins by doing, not by convincing.

People's explanations for what they do are just words, stories they tell themselves. What they do, on the other hand, is tangible and measurable and that's what we should focus on.

What matters in life isn't how frequently one is *right* about outcomes, but how much one makes when one is right.

If something works, it cannot be stupid or irrational. Wht is rational is what allows the collective to survive.

Architects today build to impress other architects, and we end up with strange - irreversible - structures that do not satisfy the well-being of their residents; it takes time and a lot of progressive tinkering for that.

Specialization comes with side effects, one of which is separating labor from the fruits of labor.

People who see complicated solutions do not have an incentive to implement simplified ones.

When you are rewarded for perception, not results, you need to show sophistication.

When you have skin in the game, dull things like checking the safety of the aircraft because you may be forced to be a passenger in it cease to be boring. If you are an investor in a company, doing ultra-boring things like reading the footnotes of a financial statement becomes almost not boring.

If you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing.

People fail to realize that the principal thing you can learn from a professor is how to be a professor - and the chief thing you can learn fomra life coach or a motivational speaker is how to become a life coach or a motivational speaker.

Learning is rooted in repetition and convexity, meaning tha tthe reading of a single text twice is more profitable than reading two different things once, provided that said text has some depth of content.

No person in a transaction should have certainty about the outcome while the other one has uncertainty.

It is always convenient to invoke universalism when you are in the majority.

A doctor is pushed by the system to transfer risk from himself to you, and from the present into the future, or from the immediate future into a more distant future.

There exists a certain community size below which people act as collectivists, protecting the commons, as if the entire unit became rational. Such a commons cannot be too large. It is like a club (the very purpose of a club is exclusion and size limitation). Groups behave differently at different scales.

**Intolerance and collective agency**

The main idea behind complex systems is that the ensemble behaves in ways not predicted by its components. The parts and the whole differ because what matters are the interactions between the parts. Studying individual ants will almost _never_ give us a clear indication of how the ant colony operates. For that, one needs to understand an ant colony as an ant colony, no less, no more, not a collection of ants.

All it takes is a small number of intolerant, [virtuous] people with skin in the game (most often in the form of courage) for society to function [properly]. This requires two things: first, the minority must be evenly distributed (spatially) across the population. Second, complying with the intolerant minority must cost less than the alternative.

The market is like a large movie theater with a small door. And the best way to detect a sucker is to see if his focus is on the size of the theater rather than that of the door. 

The average behavior of the market participant will not allow us to understand the general behavior of the market.

Individuals don't need to know where they are going; markets do.

**Wolves among dogs**

Every organization wants a certain number of people associated with it to be deprived of a certain share of their freedom. How do you own these people? First, by conditioning and psychological manipulation; second, by tweaking them to have some skin in the game, forcing them to have something significant to lose if they disobey authority.

Evidence of submission is displayed by the employee's going through years depriving himself of his personal freedom for nine hours every day, his ritualistic and punctual arrival at an office, his denying himself his own schedule.

Someone who has been employed for a while is giving you strong evidence of submission.

A company man is someone who feels that he has something huge to lose if he doesn't behave as a company man - that is, he has skin in the game.

People are no longer owned by a company, but by the idea that they need to be _employable_. The employable person is embedded in an industry, with fear of upsetting not just their emplpyer, but _other_ potential employers.

An employee is - by design - more valuable inside a firm than outside of it; that is, more valuable to the employer than the marketplace.

Ronald Coase on why firms exist - Contracts can be too costly to negotiate due to transaction costs; the solution is to incorporate your business and hire emplpyees with clear job descriptions because you can't afford legal and organizational bills for every transaction. A free market is a place where forces act to determine specialization, and information travels via price point; but *within* a firm these market forces are lifted because they cost more to run than the benefits they bring. So market forces will cause the firm to aim for the optimal ratio of employees and outside contractors. (Taleb adds that an employee is also a risk-management strategy, with the analogy of the Romans having slaves do their finances, because a slave has more to lose by being dishonest or irresponsible)

**On loss aversion:** what matters isn't what a person has or doesn't have; it is what they are afraid of losing. The more you have to lose, the more fragile you are.

People whose survival depends on qualitative "job assessments" by someone of higher rank in an organization cannot be trusted for critical decisions.

**The skin of others in your game**

To make ethical choices you cannot have dilemmas between the particular (friends, family) and the general. Intellectual and ethical freedom requires the absence o the skin of others in one's game, which is why the free are so rare.

**Inequality**

There are two kinds of inequality; the first is the inequality people tolerate, such as one's understanding compares to that of people deemed heroes, in comparison to whom one has no difficulty acknowledging a large surplus. One may like to imitate them, one may asipire to be like them, but one doesn't resent them. The second is the inequality people find intolerable because the subject appears to be just a person like you, except they have been playing the system, and getting themselves into rent-seeking, acquiring privileges that are not warranted - you cannot possibly become a fan. They make you feel smaller.

The way to make society more equal is by forcing (through skin in the game) the rich to be subjected to the risk of exiting from the 1 percent.

The problem is never the problem; it is how people handle it.

Having rich people in a public office is very different from having public people become rich - it is the dynamic, the sequence, that matters. (It is downright unethical to use public office for enrichment)

Fragility is sensitivity to disorder. Fragile things have asymmetric responses to volatility and other stressors, and will experience more harm than benefit from them.

**On peers and judgment**

You can define a free person precisely as someone whose fate is not centrally or directly dependent on peer assessment. 

A free person does not need to win arguments - just win.

Change for the sake of change is frequently the opposite of progress.

Contemporary peers are valuable collaborators, not final judges.

The bureaucratization of the activity [of peer-assessment] creates a class of new judges: administrators who have no clue what someone is doing except via external signals, yet become the actual arbiters.


The most convincing statements are those in which one stands to lose, ones in which one has maximal skin in the game; the most unconvincing ones are those in which one patently tries to enhance one's status without making a tangible contribution.

Ideas need to have skin in the game. You know an idea will fail if it is not useful, and can therefore be vulnerable to the falsification of time.

If an idea has skin in the game, it is not in the *truth* game, but in the harm game. An idea survives if it is a good risk manager - that is, not only doesn't it harm its holders, but favors their survival (ideas that bring about beneficial reductions of fragility).
