This was first audiobook I've listened to in a long time, since [American Gods](https://www.amazon.com/American-Gods-Tenth-Anniversary-Production/dp/B005745I4C) (which was amazing).  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I enjoyed the narration. 

Mallaby gives a fascinating account of how the American venture capital culture/ecosystem/industry has evolved, and how it is connected to and helped nurture the VC ecosystems in China and India. 

The book doesn't talk at all about Europe, though. I don't know if this means Mallaby thinks there isn't much to say about European VC culture, but given how deeply he described the rise of unicorns like Uber, Google, and Facebook, I was just a little disappointed that he didn't talk about European startups like Spotify, Gorillas, Klarna, or Alan (I'm sure there are quite a few more).
