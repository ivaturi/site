A few  issues I have with most conversations about prioritizing based on _impact_ and _effort_:

1. They are always plotted as single points of data on a two-dimensional grid, which conveniently ignores how impact and effort change over _time_. This makes the entire prioritization an extremely volatile, short-term approach to things.
2. They are never explicit about _who_ is being impacted. It isn't a straightforward comparison between features if they affect different target audiences differently (which inevitably happens, unless you only ever have one customer)
3. They don't include conversations about _risk_. True innovation requires taking risks and accepting failure. Not thinking about risks means only those things get prioritized that push the current state towards a known, certain future - which means no real risk-taking ever happens.
