To get better at something, all I have to do is set my expectations higher about how well I think I can do it. But this implies I already know what *better* looks like. What if it is something I have never done before, a subject that is completely foreign to me?

Maybe I want to get better at playing a video game, or playing a musical instrument I haven't been exposed to before. How do I know what it looks like to be really good at it? The simplest answer is that I look at how other people are doing it. I look at a professional gamer, or a concert musician, so I have a fair idea of what it looks like to be really good at this thing I want to do. This gives me a framework for my expectations about myself.

To know whether or not I'm *really* getting better at it, I can do one of two things - I can assess myself against the highest standard I know of - the professional gamer, or the musician. This can be problematic, because it introduces a subjective bias. How good am I, really, at assessing my performance in something I am not an expert at?

The other way to do this is to get someone who is able to objectively evaluate my performance against a standard, so I can understand what *better* looks like, and  give me an incentive to work towards being better. This, I think, is at the heart of what every competition is about. I compete not to *win*, but to explore the limits of what I can do, and what is possible.

Ultimately, my competition is not against other people, but against myself - every time I compete with others, I am using them as a benchmark to evaluate my past self, to see how much better I can get.
