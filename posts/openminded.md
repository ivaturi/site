To be truly open-minded, it isn't enough to be open to listening to dissenting or contrary opinions - that's the easy part. You must be willing to go further: accept that the dissenting opinion is _exactly_ as valid as yours, and accept that there exists a perspective where your opinion is _wrong_. 

You must be willing to make the jump to the other perspective.

But you can't do that unless every time you voice an opinion, you are willing to accept that it is wrong and that you are willing to reconsider it.

It also means that every time you run into someone else's opinion, your default mode is to accept and validate it - even if you don't agree with it.
