One of the harder lessons I've learned about taking advice: nobody is as invested in my growth/success as I am. Any advice I get, well-intentioned or otherwise, is mostly just going to be the _convenient_ sort. Very few people who give me advice have anything to lose if it doesn't work out for me - this isn't useful at all.

Here's what I should try doing instead: 

* Find people who have succeeded at what I want to do
* Give them a stake in my success
* Take their advice

(Of course, this means if I'm doing something nobody has done before, I should really only take my advice and ignore everything else)
