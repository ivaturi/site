It's easy to come up with a hundred different things that could go wrong, that could prevent the now from going to the future you envision. It's harder to know which of those might be the most important problems to solve. 

What's harder to do than that? Inhabit the future that you dream of, and work your way backwards to the now. At each step, what is the one thing that stands in your way of coming back to the present? This helps you imagine problems that you wouldn't otherwise see or expect.

This is obviously hard to do. If it were easy, everyone would be a visionary.
