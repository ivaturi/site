It's easy to come up with a hundred different things that could go wrong, that could prevent the now from going to the future you envision. It's harder to know which of those might be the most important problems to solve. 

What is even harder, is inhabiting the future that you dream of, and work your way backwards to the now. At each step, what is the one thing that stands in your way of coming back to the present? This helps you imagine problems that you wouldn't otherwise see or expect.

* What are some examples of doing this?
* How do you know if you're doing this right?
