I've taken to reading random extracts from [Patricia Highsmith's Diaries and Notebooks](https://www.amazon.com/Patricia-Highsmith-Diaries-Notebooks-1941-1995/dp/1324090995) when I can't sleep. 

Two quotes I've read recently that stuck:

> It is not age in the sense of an unknown future that is so terrifying. It is the people in the past that we ourselves have been and left behind and do not know any longer.

> To own a house is to stop in a way [in a way that I can't yet]
