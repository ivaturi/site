### Thoughts on stuff

* Most of the original signatories of the agile manifesto were/are consultants. 
* This reasoning, from my 5-year old: "What happens when people in different places want to watch TV at the same time as we do? What if they want to watch different channels than us? They can't all wait for us to stop. That means they must have the internet at the same time, so they can do different things. That means the internet is for everyone, not just us."
