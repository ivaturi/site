The obsession with studying creativity is a modern invention.

Basic rule: if there is something you want to do, do it, and do it often. To improve (faster), seek advice from people who've been where you are.

Creativity as novelty is always relative; what one person finds new or interesting might be boring old news to someone else.

We spend so much time and effort trying to be more efficient, that doing anything (else) interesting feels like a waste of time.

Get comfortable asking yourself these questions:

- In what situations do I feel most creative?
- How can I protect time each day to work on a creative project?
- What are the daily habits of creative people I admire?
- What attitudes do I have that help or hinder me?


If your goal is to find interesting things, will it matter which direction you go in first?

To _explore_, you must do things where you are not sure of the outcome.

The simplest way to get started is to keep a journal. We don't notice how much we forget, so it's critical to preserve our ideas. Journaling also lets us capture hidden patterns in our ideas.

All ideas are made of other ideas. It is hard to see this because by the time we experience an idea, it seems complete on its own. The act of creating an idea is always an act of bringing together existing ideas.
