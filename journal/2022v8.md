#### Stuff I've thought about this week

* One of the biggest reasons it's hard to convince legacy product organizations to invest in improving their UX is because they've already seen that they don't _need_ that investment to make a successful product (how many times have you looked at a product and wondered how the company that makes it makes so much money off it when their product is a pain to work with?). 

* The two most important things you can do for yourself: first, accept that your worldview is always incomplete and inadequate. Second, talk to people and do things that stretch your worldview (if you can't do these, _read_ things that stretch your worldview).  

* An interesting way to approach (seemingly improbable) ideas, from [The power law](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Law-Venture-Capital-Making/dp/052555999X):  instead of trying to prove an idea works, try to come up with one obvious way the idea cannot possibly work. 

* If you want to change anything about people, start by paying attention to the things they do by default. These are what they will resist _the most_.
